Title:
Escryptow: Design and Implementation of an E-commerce Dapp

Abstract:
The online marketplace and escrow system show great potential to be incorporated with and benefit tremendously from emerging blockchain technology. Our project focus on creating a decentralized, blockchain-based online marketplace that provides similar online transaction and shopping experiences for users while guaranteeing high degrees of user anonymity and autonomy. Building upon the smart contract for the peer-to-peer transactions we created in Quarter 1, we established a ready-to-launch website as the frontend client to deliver to users and added more comprehensive functionalities to the contract, together creating a marketing system that enables automated transactions between multiple users. The system will have advantages such as high user anonymity, reliable transaction without third-party interventions, accessible transaction histories, and a usable interface that accommodates different actions. We divided our task into parallel groups to design and collectively develop the website. The frontends’ focus was the webpage design, which should transform our contract into an actual usable product. We created UI and visual elements to facilitate navigation experiences and build the connection between the website, the underlying smart contract, and all external resources necessary for blockchain transactions. The backends’ primary goal was to create the advanced functionalities of the transaction system and multiple utility functionalities for the website. We developed the smart contracts through Remix IDE and deployed the contracts on the Goerli Ethereum testnet to eventually run as a holistic system.
